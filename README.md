# Projects by Ethan Frost

This is a hub for the projects I'm developing while earning [Free Code Camp](https://about.freecodecamp.org/)'s front-end, data visualization, and back-end certifications. You can check them out on [my website](https://www.ethan-frost.com/). It works on Windows and iOS and most modern browsers (not IE). I've included comments, user stories, and external resources with each project.

Regrettably, a large part of this project's history is not available on GitHub. I did the front-end projects on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), then moved to [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for the back-end projects. The only metric I cared about was "does it solve the problem," so my code was a mess. I created this repository after I'd cleaned it up a bit.

In the weeks to follow, I'll be working through the full-stack web apps for the back-end certification (and probably doing more refactoring). I'll be using React/Redux on the front end, Express and MongoDB on the back end. These projects will include tests. My goal is to enter the field as a competent junior web developer.

Topics I want to learn more about:

1. Full-stack web app design
2. Test-driven development (and property-based testing)
3. Time and space complexity analysis
