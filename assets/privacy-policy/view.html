However, you may be required to provide certain personal information to us when you elect to use certain products or services available on the Site. These may include: (a) registering for an account on our Site; (b) entering a sweepstakes or contest sponsored by us or one of our partners; (c) signing up for special offers from selected third parties; (d) sending us an email message; (e) submitting your credit card or other payment information when ordering and purchasing products and services on our Site.

    <div class="u-margin-full">
      <h3 class="u-margin-full">Sharing Information with Third Parties</h3>
      <p>EFF does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.</p>
      <p>EFF may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to EFF, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="u-margin-full">
      <h3 class="u-margin-full">Automatically Collected Information</h3>
      <p>Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by EFF. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the EFF website.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="u-margin-full">
      <h3 class="u-margin-full">Use of Cookies</h3>
      <p>The EFF website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
      <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize EFF pages, or register with EFF site or services, a cookie helps EFF to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same EFF website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the EFF features that you customized.</p>
      <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the EFF services or websites you visit.</p>

      <h3 class="u-margin-full">Security of your Personal Information</h3>
      <p>EFF secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. EFF uses the following methods for this purpose:</p>
      <ul class="u-margin-p">
        <li>SSL Protocol</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
      <p>We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or alteration of your personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b) security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed.</p>
